| `staging`     | Pre-release testing, integration of all features. Could even add a series of testing branch if there was a testing team. | Mirrors production with newer features; triggers full CI/CD suite     |
| `bugfix/*`    | Specific bug fix branches                        | Branched off `staging` or `main` depending on urgency                 |
