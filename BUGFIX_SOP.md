## üåø Branching Strategy Overview

| Branch                | Purpose                                          | Notes                                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `main` / `production` | Stable release code for live deployments         | Protected: only updated via pull request from `staging` |
| `staging`             | Pre-release testing, integration of all features | Triggers full CI/CD; review gateway to `main`           |
| `feature/*`           | New features                                     | Branch off `staging`; merge via PR after review         |
| `bugfix/*`            | Bug fixes                                        | Branch off `staging`; fast-track merges if urgent       |
| `hotfix/*`            | Emergency patches                                | Branch off `main`; must also merge to `staging`         |
| `dev` (optional)      | Safe sandbox                                     | Junior developers may test and collaborate              |
